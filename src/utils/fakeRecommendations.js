      "1 Put the fennel, aubergine, pepper and courgette in a roasting tray. Add a glug of olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss around to coat the veggies in the oil. Roast in the oven for 20 minutes, turning a couple of times until the veg are pretty much cooked through and turning golden.\r\n\r\n2 Meanwhile, heat a paella pan or large frying pan over a low– medium heat and add a glug of olive oil. Sauté the onion for 8–10 minutes until softened. Increase the heat to medium and stir in the rice, paprika and saffron. Cook for around 1 minute to start toasting the rice, then add the white wine. Reduce by about half before stirring in two-thirds of the stock. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes without a lid, stirring a couple of times.\r\n\r\n3 Stir in the peas, add some seasoning, then gently mix in the roasted veg. Pour over the remaining stock, arrange the lemon wedges on top and cover with a lid or some aluminium foil. Cook for a further 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n4 To ensure you get the classic layer of toasted rice at the bottom of the pan, increase the heat to high until you hear a slight crackle. Remove from the heat and sit for 5 minutes before sprinkling over the parsley and serving.",

Discard any skin or bones.\r\nFor the dumplings, mix the flour and suet with a pinch of salt and 250ml/9fl oz water to make a dough.\r\nWrap the mixture in clingfilm and leave in the fridge to rest.\r\nOpen the can of ackee, drain and rinse, then set aside.\r\nHeat a tablespoon of olive oil in a pan and fry the onion until softened but not brown.\r\nAdd the spices, seasoning, pepper sauce and sliced peppers and continue to fry until the peppers are tender.\r\nAdd the chopped tomatoes, then the salt cod and mix together. Lastly stir in the ackee very gently and leave to simmer until ready to serve.\r\nWhen you’re almost ready to eat, heat about 1cm/½in vegetable oil in a frying pan and heat until just smoking.\r\nShape the dumpling mix into plum-size balls and shallow-fry until golden-brown. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave the pan unattended.)\r\nDrain the dumplings on kitchen paper and serve with the saltfish and ackee.",
