My first has been to modularise Home page and extract from it two components and two arrays.

  -Utils:
    I decided to create a new folder named "utils" with a corresponding file for each variable: fakeRecipies and fakeRecommendations. 
    After creating each file, each variable has been exported to its corresponding component.

  -Components:
    Home.jsx was overloaded with a lot of responsibilities that could be extracted into new components. Thus, I created "components" folder where the components will have each own folder.
    Separating functions from Home.jsx into smaller components, everything is easier to read and, easier to correct (in case of bugs) and it's more scalable.
    In each folder there will be an extra file which will be its corresponding styled-components file.
    

  -Photo: 
    I decided to remove the functions renderImage and renderImageBox as I have added a conditional checking if item.photo exists or not.
    
  -Details:
    Extracted the component part from Detail page into DetailsRecipe component. Corrected the details page to always show the data from the selected recipe. To do that, I changed how
    Link path to add the id of the requested recipe, and the id will be get through params with useParams. After getting the id, the page will filter that id to find the desired recipe and
    it will pass the data (destructuring it first) through props.
    Changed all headings. H1 is only for the recipe name, as it is the most important element semantically speaking. Now headings related to topics have been changed to h2 and subtopics to h3.

  -Heading:
    Created a Layout component containing the heading, and it will wrapp App component. Doing it this way, Heading element will be displayed in every page and will be make our code easier to fix
    and more scalable, as we can add more features easily such as a footer.

  -Recipies: 
    Changed the div containing the info to an unordered list, and <p> elements to list items as it is semantically better in that case.
    Changed order between category and recipe name. Now recipe name will be displayed above the category name.
    Removed fakeData and fakeRecipies in order to avoid repeating unnecessary code. Instead, created a carousel to show recommendations.

  -TypeScript: 
    Installed TypeScript and changed all the files to its corresponding extension. JSX files are now TSX, and JS files are now TS.
    Created a tsconfig.json file with basic configuration to be able to run react-jsx with latest ECMAScript version.
    Created an Interfaces folder with a Recipe interface file. In this file a Recipe interface has been created to type the Recipe data.
    All the components's return are typed to be JSX.Element.
    A RecipeObjectProps interface has been created in DetailsRecipe.tsx to type the result of DetailsRecipe props.

  -StyledComponents:
    Created StyledComponents files for each Component with its corresponding global css rules.
    All the css rules applied to styled components are nested if it's possible. 
    After moving all the global css rules, I have deleted the CSS files as they are no longer required.
